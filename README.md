# Immutable-Passport-Integration-Guide
This guide will help you integrate Immutable Passport into your application, allowing users to authenticate and initiate transactions. Immutable Passport provides easy access to the Immutable X blockchain, enabling secure transactions and user authentication.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js installed on your system
- A basic understanding of JavaScript and web development
- An Immutable Developer Hub account

## Step 1: Setting up a Simple Application

 You can either create a new application or clone a simple repository. For this guide, we'll create a basic application from scratch.

     1. Create a new directory for your project:
         ```bash
         mkdir passport-integration
         cd passport-integration
    
     2. Initialize a new Node.js project:
        npm init -y
  
     3. Install required dependencies:
        npm install express passport passport-immutable
    
     4. Create an index.js file and set up a simple Express server.
    
     5. Create an index.html file for the frontend.

## Step 2: Registering the Application on Immutable Developer Hub

  To integrate Immutable Passport, you need to register your application on the Immutable Developer Hub.
    
    1. Go to the Immutable Developer Hub website (https://developer.immutable.com/).
    
    2. Sign in with your account or create a new one if you haven't already.
    
    3. Create a new application and follow the instructions to obtain your Passport Client ID and Secret.

## Step 3: Installing and Initializing the Passport Client

  Now, let's install the Passport client and initialize it in your application.
  
  1. Install the passport-immutable module:
      npm install passport-immutable
  2. In your index.js file, configure Passport with your Client ID and Secret:
     const passport = require('passport');
     const { ImmutableStrategy } = require('passport-immutable');
      
     passport.use(new ImmutableStrategy({
          clientID: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
          clientSecret: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',
     }));
  3. Initialize Passport in your Express app:
     const express = require('express');
     const app = express();
  
     app.use(passport.initialize());
## Step 4: Logging in a User with Passport
  Now, let's set up the user login functionality using Immutable Passport.
    1. Create a route for user login:
        app.get('/login', passport.authenticate('immutable'));
    
    2. Handle the callback URL where the user is redirected after authentication:
        app.get('/callback', passport.authenticate('immutable', {
            successRedirect: '/profile',
            failureRedirect: '/',
        }));
    3. Create a route to display the user's profile:
        app.get('/profile', (req, res) => {
            res.send(`Welcome, ${req.user.nickname}!`);
        });
        
## Step 5: Logging Out a User
  Implementing user logout is straightforward. Add a route for user logout:
    app.get('/logout', (req, res) => {
        req.logout();
        res.redirect('/');
    });
    
## Step 6: Initiating a Transaction
  To initiate a transaction using Immutable Passport, you can create a route that interacts with the Immutable X blockchain. This can include sending assets, obtaining a transaction hash, and more.

javascript
Copy code
app.get('/initiate-transaction', (req, res) => {
    // Your transaction logic here
});
Step 7: Start the Application
Finally, start your Express server:

bash
Copy code
node index.js
Your application is now integrated with Immutable Passport! Users can log in, log out, and initiate transactions securely.

Feel free to expand on these steps and include additional information and code snippets as needed in your GitHub repository. You can also include sample app files for a more hands-on experience. Once your guide is ready, upload it to a public GitHub repository and share the link for easy access to the complete guide and source code.
